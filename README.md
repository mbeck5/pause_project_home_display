# Fast Pause Project - Home Automation Display

For work sabbatical, I am going to work on a home display. I plan on incorporating many different forms of automation for my home while consolidating it all into a home display. My day 1 plan is to use Magic Mirror as the basis for my home display and use Google Assistant + IFTT for home automation.



# Weather API - OpenWeather
Website: https://openweathermap.org/appid

API Key:<br/>
Location Keys <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tacoma: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University Place: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellington: <br/>
  
Note: Could try and see if I can send a call to openweathermap with a location name, return the location key, and run a script to auto update the config file.
