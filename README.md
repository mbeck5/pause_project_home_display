# Fast Pause Project - Home Automation Display

For work sabbatical, I am going to work on a home display. I plan on incorporating many different forms of automation for my home while consolidating it all into a home display. My day 1 plan is to use Magic Mirror as the basis for my home display and use Google Assistant + IFTT for home automation.
